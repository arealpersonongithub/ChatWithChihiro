# ChatWithChihiro<br>
Simple Python chatbot. Response data handcrafted from original character writing.<br>

Dependencies:<br>
- Python 3.6.x<br>
- Numpyt<br>
- Tensorflow (1.15.0 supported)<br>
- NLTKt<br>

----
To use:<br>
Runs out of the box. Download both files and run to generate a model. The same window will then begin the chat.<br>

To customize:<br>
Edit intents.json. "Pattern" is what the bot listens to. "Response" is what it responds with. Format is a standard dictionary.<br>

Why a static dictionary?<br>
To preserve character fidelity. Handcrafting additional entries ensures the original personality is not lost, if you will.<br>

Contributions:<br>
Very much welcome, especially for the intents dictionary.<br>
